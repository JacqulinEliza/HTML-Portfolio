<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Jacquline. I'm a newbie to the web dev world with zero experience in tech, but I have a *very strong* Wi-Fi connection and an "I can do anything" attitude.</p>
<p>Although I don't come from a computer science background, I've always enjoyed learning, problem-solving, and creating new things.</p>
<p>I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript through multiple online courses and YouTube videos.</p>
<p>When I'm not learning code, you can catch me on a mountain, observing my tarantulas, struggling to keep my house plants alive or bump shoulders with me at your local coffee shop.</p>
<p>My goal is to become a full stack developer and create websites and applications that are useful with tools that solve real problems, help people connect, and make everyday tasks easier (and maybe more enjoyable too!).</p>
<p>If you have made it here, welcome! Please continue to join me on my learning journey.</p>
